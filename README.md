# Insurance Policy

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and deploy a chatbot that assists insurance companies by generating new policies or documents efficiently and accurately. The chatbot will utilize cutting-edge technologies, including Deepset Haystack, LangChain, and OpenAI GPT models.

Additionally, the chatbot will be able to search the internet for the latest news related to insurance companies and policies and create a summary of the most relevant information for the user.

## We want to create a chatbot agent that functions as an assistant to:

+ Answer questions about policies and insurance by consulting the database, for example, "What is the validity and duration of the policy for INDIVIDUAL CATASTROPHIC INSURANCE PER EVENT?", "Briefly list the coverage clauses of the previous insurance", etc...
+ Possibility of searching for news on the internet if the user requests it, combining news and creating a summary
+ Ideally, optionally, recombine different sections of policies and create a new one.

To simplify the problem, it is proposed that article number 2 (Coverage) of the attached general policies can be recombined into a new document. The result should be a "Coverage" text that combines the knowledge of the previous three documents.

## Key Features:
1. Policy Generation: Utilize ChatGPT to generate answers to questions related to insurance policies.
2. Database Access: Draw upon a database of previous policies to efficiently create new ones.
3. Internet Search: Conduct internet searches for the latest news related to insurance companies and policies, summarizing the most relevant information for users.

## Technologies Used:
1. Deepset Haystack: A search engine designed specifically for structured data, enabling efficient searching and filtering of policy documents.
2. LangChain: A language model-based tool that enables natural language processing (NLP) tasks in academia and industry.
3. OpenAI GPT Models: Utilized to generate human-like text based on user input.

## Deployment:
1. User Interface: Deploy the chatbot to a user interface, such as a website or mobile app, enabling users to ask questions related to specific companies and receive accurate and reliable answers.

## Benefits:
1. Efficient Policy Generation: Streamline the process of generating new policies or documents.
2. Accurate Information: Provide reliable and accurate information to customers.
3. Cutting-Edge Technology: Develop valuable skills in high demand in the job market, working with AI-powered technologies.



## GIT

 1) crear PR de mi rama sobre develop

 2) Una vez aprovado, hacer "Squash and merge"


## GITFLOW:
Pasos del flujo entero (desde que comenzamos la tarea)
1. Desde develop > Creas tu rama fix/tarea-a-realizar o feature/tarea-a-realizar
2. Desarrollas todos los cambios en tu rama y haces el pull request a develop
3. Se corrige y se mergea el PR a develop
